`CurrencyListAdapter()`

[ListAdapter](#) subclass that allows us to adapt our [OCurrency](../../com.dhirajgupta.currencies.model/-o-currency/index.md) model to be presented to the user in a [RecyclerView](#)
Fairly, standard and straightforward implementation that calculates the conversion quote given the chosen currency
and the amount to be converted.
