# Currencies

Android project in Kotlin to demonstrate usage of Jetpack architecture components to design a modern app that does simple currency conversion.

## App Architecture Components
Several Android Architecture Components from [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) are showcased in the app:

###  Jetpack Navigation
Jetpack [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/) is used in the app to navigate between two fragments on a single main activity.

### Jetpack Room Persistence

[Room Persistence](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) is used to store offline cache from REST API and serve as a [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) to power the whole app.

### MVVM architecture
Jetpack [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) and [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) are used to provide automatically updating UI for data through Room as per Android App [Architecture guidelines](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide).

### REST API
[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is used for the app's JSON REST API.

### Logging
App Debug logging is provided by Jake Wharton's [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) library.

## Documentation
App documentation generated by [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka) is available in the [javadoc/app](javadoc/app/index.md) folder.
